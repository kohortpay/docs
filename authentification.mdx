The KohortPay API uses API keys to authenticate requests.
You can view and manage your API keys in the [KohortPay Dashboard](https://dashboard.kohortpay.com).
Test mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live`.

<Warning>
  Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not
  share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub,
  client-side code, and so forth.
</Warning>

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being `Bearer sk_live_12345` where `sk_live_12345` is your **API Key**.

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_12345
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
API requests without authentication will also fail.
