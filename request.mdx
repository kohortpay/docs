## Expand object

Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter.
This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only.

In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties.
For example, a `Customer` may have an associated `Organization` ID.
Those objects can be expanded inline with the `expand` request parameter.

You can use the `expand` param on any list endpoint which returns expandable fields.

You can expand multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

Be aware that using expand will make your queries slower.

## Pagination

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods.
These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: `take`, `skip`, and `orderBy`.

The response of a list API method represents a single page in a reverse chronological stream of objects.
If you do not specify any parameters, you will receive the first page of this stream, containing the newest objects.
The limit of objects you can receive is set to 100.

Along with the data, you will receive `count` to allow you to paginate accordingly.

**Parameters**

| Name    | Type                                         | Description                                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| take    | _number_ _optional_                          | A limit on the number of objects to be returned, must be a positive int. Max 100..  |
| skip    | _number_ _optional_                          | The number of objects to skip.                                                      |
| orderBy | _string_ _optional_ _default=createdAt:desc_ | Object field to sort. Format is field:asc or desc. If none, it will default to asc. |

## Search

All top-level API resources have support for search via "list" API methods.
It allows you to filter your lists on any property of your object.

The search can be used alongside Pagination query parameters (see above) and the response will follow the same pattern.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| search | _string_ _optional_ | The property and value you want to filter on, separated by `:`. Format is `property:value`. `property` must match an existing property of the object. `value` must exactly match an existing value (case-sensitive). Example: `/customers?search=first_name:Bob` will retrieve all customers with the first name Bob. |
