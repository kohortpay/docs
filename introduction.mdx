The KohortPay API is organized around REST.
Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts application/json or form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.
All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.kohortpay.com
```

## Mode

You can use the KohortPay API in test mode, which doesn't affect your live data or interact with the banking networks.
The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode (key start with `sk_live` or `sk_test`).
